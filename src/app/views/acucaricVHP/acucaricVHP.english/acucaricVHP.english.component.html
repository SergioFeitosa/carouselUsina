        VHP sugar is another important type of sugar that has specific characteristics. Let's explore more about it:

        <p style="margin-left: 2em;" >What is VHP sugar?
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;" >The acronym “VHP” stands for “Very High Polarization”. This type of sugar is known for its high concentration of sucrose.
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;" >VHP sugar is produced from sugar cane juice and goes through an evaporation and crystallization process.
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;" >It is called “VHP” due to its high polarization, which refers to the amount of sucrose present in the sugar.
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;" >VHP sugar is generally used in the export industry, where it is transported in large quantities to other countries.
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;" >Its high concentration of sucrose makes it ideal for use in industrial processes, such as the manufacture of beverages, foods and chemicals.</p>
        Note: VHP sugar is unrefined and may contain impurities, but its high concentration of sucrose makes it valuable for many applications.
