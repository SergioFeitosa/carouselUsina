        <h4 id="divText"><b>Types of Financial Operations</b></h4>
         <b>SBLC - Transferable/NON - Transferable - NO PB 2%:</b>
             <p>It is essential to differentiate between transferable and non-transferable SBLC. While non-transferable SBLCs are confined to the original beneficiary, transferable SBLCs offer the option of transferring the credit to another party, allowing greater flexibility in business transactions.</p> <br>
         <b>DLC - LC - Transferable:</b>
             <p>A Documentary Letter of Credit is a type of LC that includes additional documentation requirements. It specifies the necessary documents that the seller must present to the bank to receive payment.
                These documents typically include commercial invoices, bills of lading, inspection certificates, and other relevant documents. DLCs provide an additional layer of security for both parties, ensuring that the seller meets all necessary obligations before receiving payment.</p><br>
         <b>CIF/FOB sale:</b>
             <p>What is CIF Shipping?
                 In CIF shipping, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks involved in transporting the goods to the recipient. In case of problems, all responsibility lies with the store and not the customer.</p>
        
             <p>What is FOB Shipping?
                 In this type of shipping, the seller is free from responsibility for the delivery of the product. Unlike CIF, here it is the buyer who assumes the costs and risks of transportation. When the purchase is completed, the seller finishes his work.
                 The modality is widely used among companies, as in cases like these it is common for the buyer to know a reliable carrier or have a partnership with a supplier, which allows delivery to be speeded up without depending on the seller.</p><br>
