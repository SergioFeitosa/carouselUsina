        <p><b>What is Non-GMO Corn? </b>

            <p style="margin-left: 2em;">Non-GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) corn is grown without genetic manipulation in the laboratory.
            The DNA of non-GMO corn remains unchanged, preserving its natural characteristics.
            Grown with traditional and sustainable agricultural methods.
            Often labeled as "natural corn" or "GMO-free corn."
           
            <p style="margin-left: 2em;">Notes<br>
            Non-GMO corn, also known as GMO-free corn, is grown through traditional agricultural methods.
            This means that the genetic code of corn is not altered in the laboratory to incorporate genes from other species.
            This preservation of corn's natural DNA ensures that its intrinsic characteristics, such as flavor, texture and nutritional value, are maintained.
            Additionally, growing non-GMO corn generally follows sustainable agricultural practices, promoting soil and environmental health.
            To make identification easier for consumers, non-GMO corn can be found labeled as "natural corn" or "GMO-free corn."
           
            <p><b>Benefits of Non-GMO Corn</b>
           
            <p style="margin-left: 2em;">Natural and authentic flavor: Non-GMO corn offers a pure and characteristic flavor, without influences from modified genes.
            Potentially more nutritious: Some studies suggest that non-GMO corn may contain higher levels of certain nutrients.
            Long-term food security: The absence of genetic modifications in non-GMO corn reduces potential food risks associated with genetically modified organisms.
            Sustainable choice: Growing non-GMO corn encourages sustainable agricultural practices and protects biodiversity.
            Transparency and consumer control: By opting for non-GMO corn, you have greater control over the food you consume.
           
            <p style="margin-left: 2em;">Notes<br>
            Choosing non-GMO corn brings with it several benefits. One of the main aspects is the flavor. As it is not genetically modified, non-GMO corn preserves its natural and characteristic flavor, that familiar taste of fresh corn. Additionally, some studies suggest that non-GMO corn may contain higher levels of certain nutrients compared to GMO corn. Choosing non-GMO corn also contributes to long-term food security by avoiding potential risks associated with genetically modified organisms. From an environmental perspective, growing non-GMO corn encourages sustainable agricultural practices that protect soil health and biodiversity. Finally, choosing non-GMO corn allows for greater transparency and control over the foods you consume, ensuring your diet aligns with your preferences.
