        Commodity transportation is an essential part of global trade as it facilitates the movement of basic raw materials such as metals, energy and agricultural products from producers to consumers in different parts of the world.<br>

        In Brazil, a country of continental dimensions and one of the largest producers of commodities in the world, road transport is mainly responsible for the flow of these goods within its territory. However, the increase in oil prices, for example, could harm the economy as a whole, as Brazil has a transport matrix that is fundamentally truck-based.<br>

        Commodity transportation challenges include the need for adequate infrastructure, delivery efficiency, cargo security and environmental sustainability. Additionally, fluctuations in commodity prices can have a significant impact on the global economy, influencing industry and commerce, resulting in more expensive or cheaper products.<br>

        Therefore, transport logistics plays a crucial role in the success of the commodities sector, being responsible for making the journey of these primary products to the consumer or export as efficient as possible.<br>    </div>
